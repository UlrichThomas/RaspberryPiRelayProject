This project was made for raspberry pi and Waveshare RPi 8-ch Relay Board
Planned overhual of project planned for late december/early january

All code and live local servers are through VScode (to be changed)

Webpage Server:
-"Live Server" VScode extension from Ritwick Dey

JSON Server:
-https://github.com/typicode/json-server

Setup project:
-download the webpage server

-use search bar in VScode to find settings.json

-add the below code anywhere in file to turn off live reload on the json file. This prevents the webpage reloading everytime the json file updates.

"liveServer.settings.ignoreFiles": [
  ".vscode/**",
  "**/db.json"
]

here is the link that I used for this step:

-open VScode terminal and type the following code to install the json server

npm install -g json-server
